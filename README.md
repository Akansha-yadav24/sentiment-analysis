## 🔍 What is Sentiment Analysis?

**Sentiment analysis** is the process of identifying emotions in text — for example:  
- "This course is amazing!" → **Positive**  
- "I'm really disappointed." → **Negative**  
- "It’s okay, I guess." → **Neutral**

This project uses `TextBlob` to analyze:
- **Polarity** → range: -1 (negative) to +1 (positive)  
- **Subjectivity** → range: 0 (objective) to 1 (opinionated)
